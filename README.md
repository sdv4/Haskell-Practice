# Haskell-Practice

This repository contains my original solutions to many of the chapter exercise problems in Haskell: the craft of functional programming (3rd edition)

I make no claim that the solutions are either optimal or error free.
If you see a mistake, feel free to let me know. If you have a better solution to one of the problems, I would like to hear about that too!
